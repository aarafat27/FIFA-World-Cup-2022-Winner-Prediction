## Poisson Distribution
The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability function that means the variable can only take specific values in a given list of numbers, probably infinite.

A Poisson distribution measures how many times an event is likely to occur within “x” period of time. In other words, we can define it as the probability distribution that results from the Poisson experiment. A Poisson experiment is a statistical experiment that classifies the experiment into two categories, such as success or failure. Poisson distribution is a limiting process of the binomial distribution.
